This is a Timeleap setup app I developed more as a learning experience in AI and coding.  I am not a developer, I a not affiliated with Timeleap in anyway, so use at your own risk.  The app should work on ARM and AMD macs.  It may work on linux or windows, but not really sure.  

The app will do the following. 
1. Install dependencies required for the Timeleap CLI.
2. Check to see if a Timeleap binary already exists, and if not download the binary. 
3. Make the binary executable. 
4. Check for any existing conf.yaml file, and if none exists, it will create one.  
5. Generate secrets.yaml, and extract the public key and place it in the conf.yaml file. 
6. Allow you to start and stop the broker and worker nodes.
7. Allow you to change the conf.yaml via the configuration button.
8. Allow you to update the Timeleap CLI by simply changing the "Release Version" to the latest version.

Any feedback or ideas are appreciated.  

I am using Deepseek AI for the majority of the coding.
